        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I love programming! Right now I'm still a college student whose major
          is Software Engineer, but I'd like to explore all kinds of things.
          Drop me an email or just text me on any platforms if there is any
          interesting thing you want to share with me! I'm super open minded.
          You can find me nearly on every social media (The links I provided are
          limited. But if you want to dig it out, you will find me tho).
        </p>
        <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
        <p>
          Can I describe myself as a Web Developer? I'm just into
          JavaScript/TypeScript and of course a little Rust. My goal is to
          become a full stack developer. I think Web Programming is really cool.
          As for Rust, I'm interested in <Link
            href='https://bevy.org/'
            external={true}>Bevy</Link
          >, a gaming engine, written in Rust, but I'm still exploring this cool
          engine and learn such a great language.
